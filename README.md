*Solar panel array deployed on a sailboat.*

## Key Features
- Interactive 3D visualization of solar panel configurations
- Dynamic shadows with sliders for changing sun position (azimuth and elevation)
- Power generation estimates based on panel specifications and sun position
- Cost estimates and budget optimization plot
- Various inputs for boat geometry and stack size/location on boat
